# Flutter Trix Card game Scores

My first ever app with Flutter and programming in general. 2 months experience only.
This app will handle the scores of a Card game named Trix/Trex.
You can find the Trix game play and rules at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trex_(card_game)

I am also totally new to Github, I am sharing this project to be able to get some feedback on my code, some improvments I can do. And also hopefully assist others with my project.
